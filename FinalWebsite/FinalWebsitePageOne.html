  <p class="text">Danny (Daniel) Michael DeVito Jr. is an American actor, director, producer, and filmmaker. Born was born on November 17, 1944 in Neptune Township, New Jersey, U.S.A. DeVito is of southern
    Italian descent and grew up in a Catholic family of 5 that consisted of his father Daniel DeVito Sr., mother Julia DeVito, and 2 older sisters. In 1962, at the age of 14, he persuaded his father to send
    him to Oratory Preparatory School in Summit, New Jersey. Then in 1966, DeVito trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and began his career in theatre. Early in his theater career, DeVito
    performed with the Colonnades Theater Lab and appeared in plays produced by the Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective.</p>

  <p class="text">In January 1971, DeVito met his wife Rhea Perlman for the first time when she attended a friend's play that DeVito just so happened to be featured in. 2 weeks later, DeVito and Perlman moved in together
    and in January 1982, they tied the knot and officially became married. DeVito and Perlman had known each other for 40 years and were married for 30 of them before the first separated in October 2012.
    They rejoined in March 2013 only to separate again for a second time in March 2017. Although they have separated twice now, Perlman states that they never considered filing for divorce and that their
    friendship is stronger now that it had been during their last years as a couple.</p>

  <p class="text">DeVito has not been shy when discussing his political views. In both the 2016 and 2020 United States Presidential election, DeVito endorsed democratic socialist candidate Bernie Sanders. DeVito also
    endorsed democratic socialist Jeremy Corbyn for Prime Minister in the United Kingdom's 2017 General Election.</p>
